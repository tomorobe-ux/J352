  <p class="leadGraph"> I think it would be well near impossible to capture and maintain the interest of readers without using data storytelling or data visualization. The visualization in this story is essential. This is a story you want readers to engage actively in to get the full picture. I do not think that would be probable without the maps and other graphics.</p>

  <h3>Writing Sports Journalism</h3>
  <p>Writing this story without graphics could prove costly. Readers may be able gain some knowledge and perspective, but it would be easy to get lost in the words. This is why the graphics allow readers to fully grasp the story. It’s also easier for readers to find specific details they might be interested in. Beyond that, the visualization, and particularly the map representation makes the story more memorable.</p> 

  <p>The visualization elements employed in the story makes things stand out. This is what really captures the interest of viewers. It also works well with the structure of the story. As readers engage with the story, the graphics bring the content to life. In contrast to only being told what happened, vivid descriptions enable readers to visualize the world, people, and events of the novel.</p>
