  <p class="leadGraph"> The new Top 9 update is here. The latest list had many changes despite no new entries. Mbappe retains his spot at the top of the list, and Haaland flies back into the top. Joao Perdo continues to climb up the ladder. Here's the full picture.</p>
  <h3> Biggest Losers</h3>
  <p> Igor Thiago fell from fifth to ninth, experiencing the biggest drop of the week. Ekitike also experienced a drop. The French striker moved to eigth on the list. Vedat Muriqi moved one spot down, going from third to fourth. Erling Haaland's rise saw him move up considerably. </p>
  
  <h4>Biggest Winners</h4>
  <p> Erling Haaland was last week's biggest winner. The Norweigan's improved form and efficincy boosted his ratings, sending him from seventh back to the top three. Victor Osimhen also received a boost. He's now seventh on the list. Sporting's Luis Suarez moved up one spot, going from fifth from sixth. </p> 

  <p> Mbappe, Haaland, and Kane lead the pack in points for goals scored, largely thanks to the large volumes of goals and impressive goal-to-game ratios. Pedro's impressive efficiency record was a major highlight of the latest update. The Brazillian scored 9/10 for efficency. Only Harry Kane currently holds a higher efficiency score with 9.6.</p>

  <p> Mbappe, Thiago and Muriqi were the only strikers to score 10/10 points for influence. Muriqi has scored more than 50% of Mallorca's goals in La Liga this season. The Kosovo international can't stop scoring. Top 9 scores are calculated weekly, grading strikers for goals, form, efficiency, influence and team performances. </p>
